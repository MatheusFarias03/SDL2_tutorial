## Project Description

I wanted to learn more about SDL2 to be able to make apps and games with it. Turns out that I found Noah's article about it, read a little bit, found interesting, and wanted to follow along and document it aswell so that I can learn from it and have everything registered here on GitHub. 

## Usage

To compile the project simply type `make all` in the root directory. To run the program, go to `build/bin` and then execute `./sdl2_tutorial.run`. You will need to have SDL2 installed in order for this to work.
